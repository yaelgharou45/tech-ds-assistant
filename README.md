Mini GPT-powered assistant that answers Python, ML, and SQL questions
A mini GPT-powered assistant that answers questions about Python, Machine Learning, and SQL.
Think of it as a lightweight “ChatGPT for Data Science” — trained and fine-tuned on technical Q&A to help developers and data scientists get instant answers.

✨ Features

GPT-like model (built from scratch in PyTorch)
- Fine-tuned Hugging Face model for Python, ML & SQL queries
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for domain knowledge
- Streamlit/Gradio web app for an interactive chatbot experience
- Designed for data science interviews, quick coding help, and learning


I built this project to:
- Learn the inner workings of transformers & LLMs
- Showcase fine-tuning and RAG skills (highly demanded in ML roles)
- Create a practical tool that’s both educational and developer-friendly
